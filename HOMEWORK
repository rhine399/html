                     Every guitarist will admit that all the compositions of Dimebag 
                     are the  most toughest riffs. Also frankly till today after him, no one really
                     played the Pantera songs the way Dimebag played cos his playing was quite impossible
                     and only a guitarist with good practice can only play like him. The death of Dimebag was really
                     tragic for the metal scene.Pantera has realeasd 21 albums and <strong>the top 5 albums are: </strong> <br>

            <strong>David Scott Mustaine</strong> (Born 1961 September 13,1961)
            is the Vocal and the guitarist of the thrash metal band <mark>Megadeth.</mark>
The speciality of Mustaine is his background music in Megadeth.
His complicated riffs (mostly in 150-182 bpm) made the songs more heavy and creative.
There always have been a competition between the heavy metal band <strong>Metallica</strong>
and Megadeth about their albums. In my opinion megadeth and metallica can't be compared
because megadeth's song is more different and "heavier" and Metallica is also heavy with a little
bit of "beauty". The <strong> top 5 albums of Megadeth</strong> are: <br>

                                    is the lead guitarist of the prog metal band <mark>Dream Theater.</mark>
                                    Whatever I say about this guy is less because he's just amazing. The beauty of Dream theater is their extremly 
                                    complicated odd time signatures in their songs (most of them are nearly an half hour)
                                    and if you want to learn their songs..... you want to kill yourself- <br>
                                    John Petrucci has also influenced a lots of musicians who are at the peak of their success now.
                                    Every albums of Dream Theater is extremly magical but if I still have to mention some they are:<br>
