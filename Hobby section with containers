                <p>
                    I am painting in my senior years with the benefit of schooling. I'm learning
the basics of form, reflective light, color-wheel importance, composition, etc. Still, not everyone can deal with the pressure of
grades or a structured format. I paint from my heart, expressing what my mind dictates, and there are no schools that teach
that. I give myself new challenges, just to see if I can produce this vision on canvas to my own satisfaction. You don't have to
have a certificate to do that.

                                        <h1>Music:</h1>
                                        <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. From a young age, I was always surrounded by music, whether it was my parents playing music around the house or listening to songs by myself. As I grew older, I developed a deep passion for music and instruments, which quickly became my favorite hobby.

                                            There is something so magical about music that speaks to me on a deep emotional level. The way a melody can convey a range of emotions, the way lyrics can tell a story, and the way a beat can make you feel alive â€“ music has a way of touching the soul in a way that nothing else can.</p>
